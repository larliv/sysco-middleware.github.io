Raul has got a bachelor's degree in System Engineering and Informatics from San Marcos University in Per√∫. When I am not improving systems, processes or reading some books, I often go surfing our beautiful waves.

 As a System Administrator at Hewlett Packard I have to lead with several challenges every day: 24 x 7 shifts, root cause analysis, monitoring complex systems, agent programming and so on . However, the best lesson I have learnt during this amazing experience is that knowledge management is a key factor to get the best outcomes from your team.
