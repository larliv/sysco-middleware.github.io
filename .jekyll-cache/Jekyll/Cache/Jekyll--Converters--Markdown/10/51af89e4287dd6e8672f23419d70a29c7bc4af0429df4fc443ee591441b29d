I"ê<p>I have some months of experience working with Vagrant and I think it‚Äôs owesome! Integration with almost all kind of virtualization platforms: VirtalBox, VMware, Docker, AWS EC2, Hyper-V and so on. Also it‚Äôs able to use differente Provisioners: Chef, Puppet, bash, Docker, Ansible. I really like it.</p>

<p>So, when I start working with Vagrant I choose VirtualBox as my virtualization platform and Chef as my provisioner, and when trying different configurations I start finding some tips to share:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First step: Should I create my base box? or should I use a base box already created?</li>
  <li>Can I increase my disk space? how?</li>
  <li>Can I increase my swap memory? how?</li>
</ol>

<p>So I decide to create a post to start creating Vagrant boxes and resolve this issues. Let‚Äôs start‚Ä¶</p>
