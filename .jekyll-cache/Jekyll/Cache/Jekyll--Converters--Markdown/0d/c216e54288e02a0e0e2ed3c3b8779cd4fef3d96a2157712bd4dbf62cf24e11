I"¾<p>Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to present a review of the book <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/applied-soa-patterns-oracle-platform">Applied SOA Patterns on the Oracle Platform</a>.</p>

<p>Once I started to read the chapters, I found it quite interesting because of these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Great introduction to SOA principles, and Oracle SOA Suite evolution</li>
  <li>Align AIA Concepts with SOA patterns</li>
  <li>A key topic for SOA success: Service Repository</li>
  <li>An extensive and complete description of Security and Error Handling</li>
</ul>

<p>It looks like a really long book (572 pages), and it is. But this is justified because it takes a great approach from concepts to examples combined with experiences and source code. This could help you to feel more confident about your SOA design decisions.</p>
