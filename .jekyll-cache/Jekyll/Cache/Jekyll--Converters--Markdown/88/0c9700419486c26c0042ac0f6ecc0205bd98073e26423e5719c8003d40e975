<p>In this document a monitor is created using JMX. This monitor is made to show the performance of a Data Source, which is deployed on a partition. Thus, MBeans are used not only to discover managed servers, but also to show partitions. In addition, as the main goal is to show the connection poolâ€™s runtime state (do not forget data sources belong to partitions) MBeans are also used to discover the resource groups related to each partition. Furthermore, the program includes a class that generates JDBC connection leaks to demonstrate how to monitor this kind of problems.</p>
