I"®<p>Together with Oracle, Sysco did host a cloud hands-on workshop for customers and partners at Lysaker. The event was booked out, and over 20 people attended.</p>

<p>The event did go through many services - and the participants got hands-on experiences with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Integration Cloud Service</li>
  <li>Process Cloud Service</li>
  <li>Java Cloud</li>
  <li>Compute Cloud</li>
  <li>Mobile Cloud</li>
</ul>

<p>They also got a sneak preview of the new API Platform we all are waiting from.</p>

<p>The hands-on was lead by local and EMEA resources from Oracle in cooperation with Sysco. Thanks to all that contributed - Jan Leemans, Tim Graves, Ian Wallis, Bjarte Drivenes, Bastiaan Van Os, Inge Os, Cato Aune, JÃ¼rgen Kress, Thrasos Thrasyvoulou, Ulla Strobel and Ann-Sofie Often.</p>

<p>We are looking forward to host a similar event later.</p>
