I"î<p>Sysco was Gold Sponsor at OUGN this week. The conference had 312 participants, and at most 9 sessions at the same time. There were speakers from 20 countries this year - and this was the 10th year the conference on the ship. The conference concept is getting better year by year - and because all are stuck on the boat for 48 hours there is a lot of arenas for social activities.</p>

<p>There were hardly any wind or waves this year - and nice weather.</p>

<p>As one of the 3 gold partners, Syscoâ€™s CEO Frank Vikingstad presented a history of the recent conferences - also those before the cruise (was in the Norwegian mountains).</p>
