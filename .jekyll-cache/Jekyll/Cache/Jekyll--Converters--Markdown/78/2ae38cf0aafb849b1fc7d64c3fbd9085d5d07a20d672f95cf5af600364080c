<p>The aim of this document is to talk about one of the most important problems that affect application servers based on the Java Virtual Machine, memory leaks.</p>

<p>‚Äú‚Ä¶a memory leak belongs to a class of situations called software aging problems. Software aging defines the loss of performance over the time because of the gradual accumulation of little problems. Other term within this kind of problem is the rejuvenation process. For example, rejuvenation happens when the system has to be restarted in order to free the memory accumulated by a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) process after a period of time‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
