I"T<p>Quick tip: Simple solution for file transfers</p>

<p>Sometimes you need to transfer files from a server or pc, without having the necessary tools available. Other times you just need a http server since some other system requires an url to get the files you need to import (like when you are importing a template into an Oracle VM repository)</p>

<p>This tips is not new, but it is still good, and I think more people should know about it.</p>

<p>If you have python installed, simply go the the directory containing the files you want to access</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python <span class="nt">-m</span> SimpleHTTPServer
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This command starts a (simple) HTTP server on port 8000
If you would like to use a different port, just add the port number (ports under 1024 requires special permission to use, you have to start the server with root/administrator privileges)</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python <span class="nt">-m</span> SimpleHTTPServer 8888
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To stop the server, just press CTRL and C</p>

<p>NB! As many other simple solutions, this could also do harm. Think (and check the security policies for your company) before you run a web server</p>
