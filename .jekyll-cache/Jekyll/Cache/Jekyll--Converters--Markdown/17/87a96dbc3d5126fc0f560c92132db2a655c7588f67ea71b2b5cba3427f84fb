I"Ì<p>Sysco have had several customers migrating to SOA Suite 12c or Service Bus 12c - and we have also presented about the topic at OUGN, OghTech and UKOUG-Tech in 2017. It was about time that we prepared a workshop for the customers who would like to know more about the process. What should they expect and what are the benefits they should get from functional improvements.</p>

<h2 id="training">Training</h2>
<p>We have prepared for a 2 day worksjop - where day 1 is focued on the migration of code from version 11 to version 12.</p>

<p>Agenda for day day 2 is to show some of the improvements in 12c (12.2) - and give hands-on examples where they can try things out themselves. We cover the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Demo 1 with basic JavaScript, JSON use in ServiceBus 12.2.1</li>
  <li>Demo 2 with JSON API call (using REST Adapters and Javascript) in OSB 12.2.1.</li>
  <li>Demo 3 with Debugging support in jDeveloper 12.2.1</li>
  <li>Demo 4 for MDS Support in OSB 12c.</li>
</ul>

<p>Expect more demos to be added over time. All can be tailored to customer needs.
