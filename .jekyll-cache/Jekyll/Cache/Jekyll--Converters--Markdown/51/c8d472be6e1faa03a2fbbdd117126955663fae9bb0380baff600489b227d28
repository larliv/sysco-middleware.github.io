<p>After a full day of work some people working late started losing their session and were unable to log back on.</p>

<p>This applies to OAM 11.1.2.2.0 and later and the basic configuration was as follows:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015-05-12-oam-session-timeout/oam_session_timeout_settings.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Nothing out of the ordinary as you can see.
The expected session lifetime is set to 12 hours (720 minutes) and idle timeout is set to 1 hour.</p>

<p>After a lot of digging, checking timeout values on the webgate, http server, load balancer and whatnot, it turned out that there is an undocumented setting in <em>oam-config.xml</em> called <strong>CredentialValidityInterval</strong> which defaults to 480 minutes (8 hours). After 8 hours users will hit this setting and lose session and the ability to log back in for another 4 hours.</p>

<p>The solution is simple, just edit the value of <strong>CredentialValidityInterval</strong> and increase it from 480 M to 720 M . Please remember to update the Version element of <em>oam-config.xml</em> or your changes will be ignored.</p>

<p><em>oam-config.xml</em></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;Setting Name="SessionConfigurations" Type="htf:map"&gt;
	... 
	&lt;!-- Change this from 480 M to 720 M --&gt; 
	&lt;Setting Name="CredentialValidityInterval" Type="htf:timeInterval"&gt;720 M&lt;/Setting&gt;
	...
&lt;/Setting&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="fa fa-magic">&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; Did you know that you can also set session idle timeout at domain level?</div>
