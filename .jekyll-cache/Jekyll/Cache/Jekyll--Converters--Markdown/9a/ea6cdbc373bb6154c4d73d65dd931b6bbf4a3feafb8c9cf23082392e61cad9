<p>We have some customers which only use OSB  - and not SOA Suite. When you want to patch - should you look only at WLS and OSB-patches? The answer is no.</p>

<p>One such reason is documented on MOS: Should the SOA Bundle Patches for 11g and 12c be applied to OSB (Doc ID 2102449.1). It states:
In 12c, since OSB services can use JCA technology adapters, there is value in applying the SOA Bundle Patches where fixes to these adapters are included.</p>

<p>The other reason is because JDeveloper has common features in the two products. For example SOA patch  22226040: java.lang.NullPointer for XQuery File ver 1.0 in JDEV 12.2.1 OSB Proj - is one you would like to use for OSB on 12.2.1. The problem is shown in our blog post: <a href="http://blog.sysco.no/soa/JDev-OSB_Projects-Migrated/">OSB Patch</a>. If the patch does not work - remember to do the cleanup-steps mentioned at the end of the blog.</p>

<p>My advise is to create a predefined Patch Search in MOD so you can monitor existing patches. Here are some of my searches.</p>

<p>One good thing you can see is the last time you searched. For example for OSB - then WLS, SOA and OSB are relevant. My advise is to order patches so you see tha latest updates first, and that you at least should add the recommended patches.</p>

<p>It is not easy to see which of the patches are relevant only for JDeveloper/Quickstart, and which are only relevant for server.</p>
