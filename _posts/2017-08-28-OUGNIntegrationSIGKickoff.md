Finally we got to kick off the OUGN Integration SIG that we have talked about for so long time. This first time we had participants from customer Apotek1, Oracle, and partners Accenture, Knowit, Steria and Sysco. There were 15 participants - but the total meetup group now has almost 50 people.

Here is link to the meeetup:  [OUGN Integration SIG](https://www.meetup.com/Integration-OUGN-SIG/). 

We agreed that we should have approx 4 meetups per year, and that we normally should start after hours - at 16.00. 2 hours would be the normal duration, but longer for topics that need time. What looks like will be the topic for next time will be DevOps-experiences - testing, documentation, provisioning, build and deploy - and more. All have things to share in this area - and the goal for this SIG is to help the participants to create value for the customers investments in the Oracle software.

I did present some our experiences from our SOA / OSB migrations from 11g to 12c, but most of the time used in this first meetup was to mingle and discuss what we wanted out of this SIG.

Oracle sponsored beer and pizza - and this informal meeting was was a great success!
