Together with Oracle, Sysco did host a cloud hands-on workshop for customers and partners at Lysaker. The event was booked out, and over 20 people attended.

The event did go through many services - and the participants got hands-on experiences with:

* Integration Cloud Service
* Process Cloud Service
* Java Cloud
* Compute Cloud
* Mobile Cloud

They also got a sneak preview of the new API Platform we all are waiting from.

The hands-on was lead by local and EMEA resources from Oracle in cooperation with Sysco. Thanks to all that contributed - Jan Leemans, Tim Graves, Ian Wallis, Bjarte Drivenes, Bastiaan Van Os, Inge Os, Cato Aune, JÃ¼rgen Kress, Thrasos Thrasyvoulou, Ulla Strobel and Ann-Sofie Often.

We are looking forward to host a similar event later.
