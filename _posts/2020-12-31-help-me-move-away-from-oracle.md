# Background

A few weeks ago, our REAL (Red Expert Alliance) colleague and friend Lucas Jellema (AMIS - Netherlands), invited us to 
peer review and co-edit a comprehensive article which discusses the nuances and dynamics of this kind of scenario, which
might sound familiar to many long-time Oracle partners especially in the last few years.

The following are some of the most important questions the article poses and tries to answer:

- Are there any common denominators which keep triggering this sentiment among customers? 
- What are the foreseeable consequences of acting upon it?, especially when it leads to drastic & potentially 
de-stabilizing changes within an organization
- For us as technology advisors, what is the best course of action when faced with this kind of challenge?, how do we
stir our customers / companies in the right direction whilst keeping a balanced yet progressive approach

# Summary

With the former questions in mind, let's try to summarize and maybe even extend the answers presented by the article:

- When an organization expresses a wish to  "move away from Oracle", it is important to pinpoint exactly what this 
means; so is it the whole business relationship which is going south?, or is it a specific piece of technology that isn't
up to expectations?; perhaps the shiny new tools offered by other vendors are looking more appealing now that the 
"honeymoon" is long over and the trust has dwindled a bit.

It must be said that Oracle itself has played a part in all of this, because in their journey to become a major Cloud
player they shifted quite violently from self-assured, steady, reliable yet modern to cocky, buzzword-happy, 
hit-or-miss; since everything goes in cycles, Oracle as well seems to have turned the corner and began steadying the 
ship, with a much better understanding of their strengths, weaknesses and potential role in both the Hybrid & Cloud Native 
landscapes
