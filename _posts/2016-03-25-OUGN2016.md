# OUGN 2016
One more the OUGN conference was a great success - with 310 people on the cruise from Oslo to Kiel. Also this year with great content from Norway and the rest of the world. I have been part of the Board planning the conference, and for every year we feel we have done improvements to the experience. Many have been at the conference (often more than one time) - and many have heard about OUGN and want to come next time. So few minutes after the Call For Paper opens - we get abstracts submitted -  the majority of the first ones come from outside of Norway.

Our problem is to select abstracts - and it is a pain to have to reject many of the speakers. We try  to make a fair mix of Norwegian and International Speakers. We get a lot of support from OTH/ACE program, which will sponsor some of the ACEDs which often come a long way. For international speakers we normally plan for 2 sessions - so a tip for next year is to submit 2 or more proposals. We will also normally give a priority to customers speaking at the conference, and we would like to get new speakers to OUGN. It is important that we inspire new speakers to share. One other tip is to send proposals for different tracks - some of the tracks get more content than others.

Many speakers attended the Speakers dinner at a burger restaurant at Aker Brygge the day before the conference. This is a good way to start the conference - and both the food and social part was great this year!

One of the changes we have done is to have a fair mix of Norwegian and non-Norwegian speakers. With 8 tracks there will always be several sessions in English language to follow. Also many of the Norwegians will prepare their presentations in English language - to be prepared if there are non-Norwegians in the room. I followed the middleware-track, and most were in English there. I really appreciate the help from Maarten Smets,Deepak Arora and Yogesh Sontakke for the international contribution there. This year we had a norwegian keynote and panel debate - which was very good. For those who could not understand it, there were plenty of others friends and soon-to-become-friends to spend time with.

This must be one of the most social Oracle conferences. We all stay on the boat for 48 hours - we eat at the same restaurants, go to the same sessions and go to the same pubs/disco. The program was very packed this year - there are many sessions you want to attend, many you want to talk to.

My company Sysco had 6 presentations this year - 4 of them on middleware/strategy. I had a presentation about REST support in SOA Suite, Cato Aune on Middleware administration using Cloud Control, Arturo Viveros about Mobile Strategy and Dalibor Blazevic about storing XSML in database using SOA Suite. My presentation is availabe at [http://www.slideshare.net/jonpetterhjulstad/ougn-2016-experiences-with-rest-support-on-osbsoa-suite](REST-presentation) Most of the others are available at: [ https://drive.google.com/a/ougn.no/folderview?id=0B10dftQmBjDLTlNpZ21GYzd5Njg&usp=drive_web](OUGN presentations).
From a MW perspective the tracks: Middleware, Strategy And More and DevOps/Java is of interest.

One of the big successes this year was the Apps-track - thanks to Ellen Gravklev. They had to change room to get seats for all.

One other success this year (as last year) was the hands-on IOT/Big Data Workshop by Frode Pedersen and Inge Os. Sysco has the devices, so we will run the same workshop later.
