We demand more from our application each year. This has driven forward great new tools and frameworks for the entire stack, but we also need to modernise our development process. Waterfall was their way to go 20 years ago, but that would be a catastrophic choice today. We need to be able to rapidly respond to changing requirements, and get critical feedback as fast as possible. Modern development is moving faster than ever, and we can no longer spend months on features nobody wants. DevOps has become the solution to this. Itâ€™s a collection of practices for enabling rapid development, deployment and feedback in a highly dynamic process. The core goal is to shorten the development cycle, which is the time from when you think of a feature to that feature being deployed to all your users.

The frontend has rapidly grown over the last years to become a critical part of modern development. We need developers that specialize in creating high performance applications with great user experiences. Nobody will use a great backend with a terrible frontend. The challenge is that this DevOps revolution has traditionally been talked about from the backends perspective. That's why we need to talk about Frontend Devops. I have combined everything related to this in one video presentation witch you can watch here:
