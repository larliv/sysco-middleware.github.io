Sysco have had several customers migrating to SOA Suite 12c or Service Bus 12c - and we have also presented about the topic at OUGN, OghTech and UKOUG-Tech in 2017. It was about time that we prepared a workshop for the customers who would like to know more about the process. What should they expect and what are the benefits they should get from functional improvements.

## Training ##
We have prepared for a 2 day worksjop - where day 1 is focued on the migration of code from version 11 to version 12.

Agenda for day day 2 is to show some of the improvements in 12c (12.2) - and give hands-on examples where they can try things out themselves. We cover the following areas:

* Demo 1 with basic JavaScript, JSON use in ServiceBus 12.2.1
* Demo 2 with JSON API call (using REST Adapters and Javascript) in OSB 12.2.1.
* Demo 3 with Debugging support in jDeveloper 12.2.1
* Demo 4 for MDS Support in OSB 12c.

Expect more demos to be added over time. All can be tailored to customer needs.
Thanks to Dalibor and Denis for arrangis this first training.
