Sysco has had several customers migration to SOA Suite 12c or Service Bus 12c - we have also presented about the topic at OUGN, OghTech and UKOUG-Tech in 2017. It was about time that we prepared a workshop for the customers that would like to know more about the process.

## Training ##
We have prepared for a 2 day worksjop - where focus on day 1 is on the migration of code from version 11 to version 12.

Focus on day 2 is to show some of the improvements in 12c (12.2) - and give hands-on examples where they can try things out themselves. We cover the following areas:

* Demo 1 with basic JavaScript, JSON use in ServiceBus 12.2.1
* Demo 2 with JSON API call (using REST Adapters and Javascript) in OSB 12.2.1.
* Demo 3 with Debugging support in jDeveloper 12.2.1
* Demo 4 for MDS Support in OSB 12c.

Expect more demos to be added over time.

Contact Jon Petter to get more details if this is interesting for you.
