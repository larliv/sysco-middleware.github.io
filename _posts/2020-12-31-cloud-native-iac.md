# Introduction

This is a follow-up post with some thoughts inspired by the Rapid Fire Session: "Cloud Native, A Complete Walkthrough" in 
which I had the pleasure of participating as part of the Sangam 2020 conference (AIOUG).

I was invited to present about two of my favorite topics when it comes to Cloud Native software development: Infrastructure 
& Operations. So I have divided the post into two parts, in order to focus on one topic at a time.
